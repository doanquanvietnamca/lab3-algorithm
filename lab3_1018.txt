vector node -> save the connect between 2 node. x->y, x-> : node[x] = vector<int>(y,z)
vecotr weights -> save number apple between 2 node: weights[x]=vector<int>(number apple xy,xz)
function add_node: add node and weights to vector.
solutions:
    dynamic programming by using array dp[u][c] save the maximum number apple of root node u after replace c branches.
    u is root then have maximum 2 branches. use recursive to loop to all apple tree start with (u root)
answer:
    value dp[1][q] save the maximum number apple of root node 1 after replace q branches. Because 1 always the root of apple tree.
