function check_monoton check if 3 number is monoton: so have if x>y>z or x<y<z, then (x-y)*(y-z)>0
function sgn get sign of number: sgn(X)= {-1,1} because sumof 2 number can over load in some test. then i get only multiply of 
                                                                                                  sign of number.
state[100007] save the array without 2 consecutive equal values in the sequence: 8 8 9 -> 8 9 
dp[i] save the monoton array from 0 to i. So just get dp[len(state)] is answer of algorithm.
